# Large Model Files (Keep them if you want them BAKED into the image, otherwise ignore)
# If the user wants to keep 3GB context, we keep them.
# But usually we ignore .gguf unless explicitly needed.
# Given the user's setup copies `cmd/models`, we KEEP them for now as per user intent "build locally".
# However, we should verify if the user WANTS 3GB images.
# For safety, we keep them, but ignore other junk.
