      <title>Healthcare Use Case: Escalation and Referral Coordination</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;healthcare-without-friction&#34;&gt;Healthcare Without Friction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare teams face a convergence of connected devices, virtual care, and rising patient expectations. Every lab result, remote monitoring alert, and scheduling update carries clinical weight, yet the context often reaches coordinators too late to drive timely action. Administrative burden keeps climbing, limiting the time clinicians can devote to outreach. Runink meets caregivers inside the tools they use, translating raw telemetry into patient-centered narratives that outline urgency, ownership, and next steps. By speaking the language of care pathways, the platform helps health systems deliver equitable outcomes, reduce burnout, and build trust with patients seeking transparency into data-driven decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
