      <title>DevSecOps Use Case: Automated CVS Dependency Monitoring</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;shipping-secure-every-time&#34;&gt;Shipping Secure, Every Time&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Software delivery never sleeps, and neither do the vulnerabilities targeting your supply chain. Dependency trees stretch across microservices, infrastructure as code, container images, and third-party APIs, making traditional inventories obsolete almost instantly. Security and platform teams must collaborate at the speed of automation while communicating risk clearly to customers and regulators. When a new CVE appears, every minute matters. Runink helps DevSecOps teams respond. The platform transforms raw security telemetry into a narrative that security engineers, platform teams, and product owners all understand. With Runink, dependency monitoring becomes a proactive, explainable discipline instead of a firefight powered by spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
