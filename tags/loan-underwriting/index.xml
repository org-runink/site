      <title>Finance Use Case: Reconciliation &amp; Risk-Triggered Workflows</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;finance-in-the-spotlight&#34;&gt;Finance In The Spotlight&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern finance leaders work in an unforgiving spotlight where investor expectations, regulatory mandates, and volatility collide. Liquidity, credit exposure, and revenue forecasts must now update in hours—not months—while preserving the confidence of auditors, boards, and operating partners. Yet disparate systems, reconciliations and spreadsheet folklore still slow the storytelling that strategy demands. Runink delivers a semantic layer built for these realities, translating banking telemetry, ERP movements, capital markets data, and customer payments into a shared narrative every stakeholder can trust. With proactive insight, contextual alerts, and governance baked in, teams trade reactive close cycles for confident, faster decision velocity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
