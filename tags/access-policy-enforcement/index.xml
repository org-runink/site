      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;continuous-compliance-starts-now&#34;&gt;Continuous Compliance Starts Now&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NIST 800-53 remains the gold standard for safeguarding federal systems, platforms, and regulated organizations proving resilience. Compliance teams face scrutiny from auditors and customers who expect continuous enforcement, not quarterly evidence hunts. Security strategies revolve around zero trust, supply chain assurance, and continuous diagnostics, amplifying the need for explainable control execution. Runink delivers an automated semantic layer that turns telemetry into living control narratives. Security, compliance, and engineering stakeholders operate from the same map, ensuring deviations are captured and resolved in real time. With Runink, NIST compliance stops being a checkbox exercise and becomes an engine for trustworthy operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
