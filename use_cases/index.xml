      <title>Compliance Use Case: NIST 800-53 Controls &amp; Trigger Auditing</title>
      <link>https://runink.org/use_cases/use-cases/nist-compliance/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;continuous-compliance-starts-now&#34;&gt;Continuous Compliance Starts Now&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NIST 800-53 remains the gold standard for safeguarding federal systems, platforms, and regulated organizations proving resilience. Compliance teams face scrutiny from auditors and customers who expect continuous enforcement, not quarterly evidence hunts. Security strategies revolve around zero trust, supply chain assurance, and continuous diagnostics, amplifying the need for explainable control execution. Runink delivers an automated semantic layer that turns telemetry into living control narratives. Security, compliance, and engineering stakeholders operate from the same map, ensuring deviations are captured and resolved in real time. With Runink, NIST compliance stops being a checkbox exercise and becomes an engine for trustworthy operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DevSecOps Use Case: Automated CVS Dependency Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://runink.org/use_cases/use-cases/cvs-dependency-check/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;shipping-secure-every-time&#34;&gt;Shipping Secure, Every Time&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Software delivery never sleeps, and neither do the vulnerabilities targeting your supply chain. Dependency trees stretch across microservices, infrastructure as code, container images, and third-party APIs, making traditional inventories obsolete almost instantly. Security and platform teams must collaborate at the speed of automation while communicating risk clearly to customers and regulators. When a new CVE appears, every minute matters. Runink helps DevSecOps teams respond. The platform transforms raw security telemetry into a narrative that security engineers, platform teams, and product owners all understand. With Runink, dependency monitoring becomes a proactive, explainable discipline instead of a firefight powered by spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Finance Use Case: Reconciliation &amp; Risk-Triggered Workflows</title>
      <link>https://runink.org/use_cases/use-cases/finance/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;finance-in-the-spotlight&#34;&gt;Finance In The Spotlight&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern finance leaders work in an unforgiving spotlight where investor expectations, regulatory mandates, and volatility collide. Liquidity, credit exposure, and revenue forecasts must now update in hours—not months—while preserving the confidence of auditors, boards, and operating partners. Yet disparate systems, reconciliations and spreadsheet folklore still slow the storytelling that strategy demands. Runink delivers a semantic layer built for these realities, translating banking telemetry, ERP movements, capital markets data, and customer payments into a shared narrative every stakeholder can trust. With proactive insight, contextual alerts, and governance baked in, teams trade reactive close cycles for confident, faster decision velocity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Healthcare Use Case: Escalation and Referral Coordination</title>
      <link>https://runink.org/use_cases/use-cases/healthcare/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;healthcare-without-friction&#34;&gt;Healthcare Without Friction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare teams face a convergence of connected devices, virtual care, and rising patient expectations. Every lab result, remote monitoring alert, and scheduling update carries clinical weight, yet the context often reaches coordinators too late to drive timely action. Administrative burden keeps climbing, limiting the time clinicians can devote to outreach. Runink meets caregivers inside the tools they use, translating raw telemetry into patient-centered narratives that outline urgency, ownership, and next steps. By speaking the language of care pathways, the platform helps health systems deliver equitable outcomes, reduce burnout, and build trust with patients seeking transparency into data-driven decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Insurance Use Case: Claims Triage &amp; Fraud Signal Routing</title>
      <link>https://runink.org/use_cases/use-cases/insurance/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;claims-intelligence-starts-here&#34;&gt;Claims Intelligence Starts Here&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Carriers now operate in a landscape where telematics, self-service portals, IoT devices, and medical bill processors stream continuous signals. Customers expect rapid answers, regulators expect impeccable documentation, and executives expect loss ratios to improve even as fraud grows more sophisticated. Distribution partners push their own updates, forcing operations to reconcile many systems quickly. Runink brings order to the chaos by structuring every claim signal inside a semantic layer. Adjusters see the context behind each incident, special investigations units share the same evidence trail, and policy operations stay aligned with contractual promises, producing faster claims, lower leakage, and happier policyholders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Supply Chain Use Case: Local Fulfillment and Inventory Precision</title>
      <link>https://runink.org/use_cases/use-cases/supply-chain/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;fulfillment-without-friction&#34;&gt;Fulfillment Without Friction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Retailers and manufacturers operate in a climate where loyalty hinges on accurate promises and frictionless delivery. Every warehouse scan, vendor feed, and carrier update reflects a potential advantage or a costly miss that impacts margin and brand reputation. Runink equips operations leaders with an automated semantic layer that translates inventory telemetry into actionable stories. By aligning supply planners, store managers, and logistics coordinators around a single narrative, brands reduce oversells, protect margins, and deliver consistent experiences. The era of reactive spreadsheets fades, replaced by a fulfillment brain that learns, adapts, and communicates in language anyone on the team can trust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
