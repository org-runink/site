## Optimized Data Integration & Orchestration

Runink Data Integrator provides a powerful, lightweight alternative to traditional orchestration systems, leveraging Go-native technologies and Linux isolation for enhanced pipeline management and governance.

### System Highlights

#### Core Architecture
- Self-contained, distributed runtime environment
- Go-based scheduling and execution
- Linux-based resource isolation (`cgroups`, `namespaces`, `exec`)

#### Execution Management
- Fast, secure, and isolated pipeline steps (Slices)
- Logical grouping for multi-tenancy (Herds)
- Serverless-style execution

### Developer-Friendly Workflow

#### Efficient Pipeline Management
- Easy-to-use CLI for pipeline setup and execution
- Straightforward compilation of scenarios into executable DAGs
- Automated audit and testing capabilities

#### Governance & Compliance
- Centralized metadata management (Barn)
- Built-in data lineage and contract enforcement
- Strong consistency through Raft consensus

### Seamless Integration

#### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Initialize pipeline environment
runi herd init my-data-herd

# Compile scenario into DAG
runi compile --scenario scenario.dsl --contract contract.go --out dag.go

# Generate and audit test data
runi synth --scenario scenario.dsl --contract contract.go --golden data.json
runi audit --scenario scenario.dsl --contract contract.go --golden data.json

# Execute pipeline
runi run --dag dag.go
```

Runink Data Integrator makes data pipeline management efficient, secure, and straightforward, allowing you to focus more on insights and less on infrastructure.
