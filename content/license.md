## Runink Commercial License

Runink is a proprietary platform. Your access and usage are governed by the Runink Commercial Subscription Agreement.

### 1. Platform Subscription (SaaS)
Runink provides access to its platform under three subscription tiers: **Monitor**, **Agentic**, and **Enterprise**. This subscription grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the platform and its designated features during the subscription term.

### 2. Elite Credits (Compute Usage)
Operations executed by the Runink platform—including Data Ingestion, AI Processing, and Automated Workflows—consume **Elite Credits**.
*   **Ops Credit Calculation:** Usage is calculated by tracking compute resources (e.g., CPU utilization), rounded up per 60-second window.
*   **Allocations & Overage:** Each tier includes a monthly allocation of Elite Credits. If you exceed your monthly compute limit, operations will pause until a "Fuel Canister" top-up is purchased or the billing cycle resets. 

### 3. Outcome-Based Success Fees
Certain autonomous execution features available in the **Agentic** and **Enterprise** tiers are subject to performance-based variable fees:
*   **Auto-Provisioning:** Billed at a 3% commission on auto-provisioned purchase orders.
*   **Claims & Revenue Recovery:** Billed as a success fee (20% of recovered funds). We only win when you win.

### 4. Enterprise Deployments
Customers on the **Enterprise** tier are granted rights to utilize Air-Gapped Deployment and Bring Your Own Runner (BYOR) options. You maintain absolute data sovereignty when deploying within your private cloud.

### 5. Ownership
Runink retains all ownership and intellectual property rights to the platform, including the orchestration algorithms and base AI models. You retain full and exclusive ownership of your customer data and proprietary operational rules.

### 6. Contact
For questions regarding licensing or custom enterprise agreements, please reach out to [sales](/#contact).
