## Fulfillment Triggers. Written in Plain Language.

Imagine you're an operations lead managing fulfillment from regional warehouses and local suppliers. You're not writing SQL or coding policies‚Äîyou just want shipments routed correctly, delays handled gracefully, and inventory managed before it runs out.

Runink makes that real.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Problem

- Forecasted stock ‚â† what's actually available  
- Local suppliers can deliver faster‚Äîbut aren‚Äôt integrated  
- Ops teams rely on spreadsheets or disconnected dashboards  
- Replenishment logic is brittle, buried in SQL, or depends on a single analyst  
- SLA violations show up too late to react

---

## ‚úÖ What Runink Enables

With Runink Analytics Companion, your supply chain and fulfillment team can:

- Monitor inventory across internal and external vendors  
- Trigger restock requests when threshold breaches happen  
- Route fulfillment to local suppliers if stockouts are forecasted  
- Alert the team (or customer) before the SLA breaks  
- Score fulfillment reliability over time for vendor decisions  

All with triggers and policies defined in **plain language**, versioned with audit trails.

## üß† Example: Non-Technical Fulfillment Trigger

```yaml
trigger:
  when: inventory.available < inventory.forecasted * 0.5
  where: region = "Ontario" AND category = "Pharma OTC"
  then:
    - action: notify
      who: "ops@mycompany.com"
    - action: fallback_fulfillment
      source: "local_supplier_db"
    - action: log
      entry: "fulfillment_reroute"
````

Would you like me to proceed next with a similar use case for:

- Healthcare (e.g., clinical escalation, referral routing, or data quality triggers)
- Finance (e.g., reconciliation, cash threshold alerts)
- Insurance (e.g., claims triage, fraud scoring workflows)?
