## The Shift: From Automation to Autonomy

Most "automation" in logistics is really just scripting. *"If file A arrives, move it to Folder B."*

It's brittle. If File A changes format, the bot breaks. If the folder is full, the bot stops. This is **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)**. It's useful, but it's not intelligent.

**Agentic AI** represents a paradigm shift. Agents aren't defined by what they *do* (a script), but by what they *achieve* (an outcome). You don't tell an agent *how* to file a claim; you tell it, "Recover every eligible dollar from this shipment."

## The Architecture: See, Think, Do

Runink agents act like digital employees because they follow the same cognitive process as humans:

### 1. Perception (See)
Agents ingest unstructured data from the messy real world.
*   **Reading:** They OCR Bills of Lading, parse PDF invoices, and extract data from email threads.
*   **Seeing:** They analyze photos of damaged cargo to classify "crushed" vs. "wet."
*   **Sensing:** They monitor carrier portals and weather feeds for disruptions.

### 2. Reasoning (Think)
Agents use LLMs to understand context and make decisions.
*   **Knowledge:** They reference the Carmack Amendment, carrier tariffs, and your specific business rules.
*   **Logic:** *"The carrier denied this claim, but the photo clearly proves them wrong. I should fight this."*
*   **Planning:** *"To reroute this order, I first need to check stock in DC2, then check shipping rates, then update the OMS."*

### 3. Action (Do)
Agents have "hands." They execute tasks in your systems.
*   **Tools:** They can log into web portals, send emails, query SQL databases, and trigger APIs.
*   **Output:** They don't just give you a "suggested action"—they do the work (with your permission).

## The "Trust Gap": Human-in-the-Loop

We know "AI" sounds scary in high-stakes operations. That's why Runink uses **Augmented Autonomy**.

*   **Co-Pilot Mode:** The agent handles low-risk tasks (e.g., Claims <$100) autonomously.
*   **Supervisor Mode:** For high-stakes decisions, the agent acts as a Junior Analyst. It gathers the data, prepares the plan, and asks you for approval.
*   **Chain of Thought:** Every action comes with an explanation: *"I did X because of Y."* You can audit the agent's logic anytime.
