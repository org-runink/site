## Reduce Financial Drift. Trigger Trustworthy Action.

When finance workflows depend on batch reports and spreadsheet logic, issues are caught too late‚Äîor missed entirely. Whether you're reconciling cash flows or monitoring credit signals, delay creates exposure.

Runink lets your finance, treasury, and credit teams **trigger actions immediately** when data or behavior deviates‚Äîbacked by contracts, lineage, and audit logs.

## üí∞ Reconciliation Use Case

- Detect mismatched ledgers across systems (ERP vs banking feed)
- Trigger alerts when cash discrepancies exceed thresholds
- Route to treasury or FP&A for follow-up
- Auto-tag root causes (timing, reversal, unmatched ID)
- Audit all incidents and resolutions by SLA

### üß™ Example: Treasury Ledger Mismatch

```yaml
trigger:
  when: abs(actual_cash - ledger_cash) > 10000
  where: account_type = "operating" AND region = "US-East"
  then:
    - action: notify
      who: "treasury@finorg.com"
    - action: log
      entry: "cash_discrepancy_detected"
    - action: route
      to: "reconciliation_queue"
````

## üè¶ Loan Risk Analysis Use Case

* Monitor early warning indicators from transactional activity
* Combine credit score deltas + debt ratio + churn likelihood
* Trigger human review, flag for pricing escalation, or notify customer teams
* Score and track every risk signal with versioned logic

### üìâ Example: Escalate Risky Borrower

```yaml
trigger:
  when: credit_score_drop > 50 AND dti_ratio > 0.6
  where: loan_product = "SMB Term Loan" AND balance > 25000
  then:
    - action: notify
      who: "risk@finorg.com"
    - action: tag
      label: "monitor_risk"
    - action: log
      entry: "credit_risk_escalation"
```
