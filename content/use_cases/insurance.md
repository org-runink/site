## From Lagging Reviews to Real-Time Routing

In insurance operations, seconds matter‚Äîyet too often claims are queued manually, escalations are late, and fraud patterns go unflagged. Reviewers are overloaded. SIUs miss subtle patterns. Logic is hidden in spreadsheets or brittle ETL.

Runink brings governance and automation to your claims signals‚Äîso escalations happen fast, fraud gets routed early, and your logic is transparent.

## üöë Claims Triage: The Fastest Escalation Wins

- Define trigger logic based on claim value, severity, geolocation, or frequency
- Route to priority queues for review
- Tag cases with metadata (e.g., ‚Äúmissing ICD10‚Äù or ‚Äúduplicate VIN‚Äù)
- Notify adjusters or call center proactively
- Audit every routing and policy decision

### üßæ Example: High-Severity Auto Claim Routing

```yaml
trigger:
  when: claim.amount > 10000 AND claim.incident_type = "collision"
  where: vehicle.age < 2 AND coverage_type = "comprehensive"
  then:
    - action: notify
      who: "claims_team@insureco.com"
    - action: route
      to: "priority_review"
    - action: log
      entry: "auto_claim_escalated"
````

## üîç Fraud Detection: Pattern-Based, Audit-Ready

* Use scoring thresholds or logic patterns to flag risk
* Route to SIU, auto-reject, or pause payout
* Combine rules with upstream ML or 3rd-party signals
* Maintain a full decision trail: ‚Äúwhy flagged‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat fired‚Äù, ‚Äúwho saw it‚Äù

### üß† Example: Suspicious Pattern Signal Routing

```yaml
trigger:
  when: claim.amount > 5000 AND claim_history.count_30d > 3
  where: claimant_zip = "75001" AND treatment_code = "X9923"
  then:
    - action: tag
      label: "fraud_pattern_match"
    - action: notify
      who: "siu@insureco.com"
    - action: log
      entry: "potential_fraud_flagged"
```
