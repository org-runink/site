## From Control Checklists to Triggered Evidence

Compliance teams face a gap: controls like NIST 800-53 demand evidence, not just config files. But proving access, retention, and lineage across dynamic pipelines is hard‚Äîand usually too late.

Runink turns governance into **actionable workflows**: trigger audits when controls are breached, enforce policies at runtime, and generate structured evidence for review.

## üîê Sample Use Case: Audit PII Handling on Data Pull

- Monitor usage of columns tagged as `PII`  
- Trigger log event when sensitive fields are queried by unauthorized users  
- Route escalations to compliance team  
- Store contract violations in auditable lineage store  

### Example Trigger: NIST AC-6 (Least Privilege)

```yaml
trigger:
  when: query.field in ["ssn", "dob", "address"] AND query.user.role != "data_compliance"
  then:
    - action: log
      entry: "PII access violation"
    - action: notify
      who: "compliance@org.com"
    - action: tag
      label: "access_violation"
